# Mole Simulator

[LIVE DEMO](http://xpl.github.io/mole/)

## Running locally

Clone repo, then `npm install` to install dependencies, then `nodemon server.js` (will run at localhost:1333)

You will need npm, node.js and (optionally) nodemon. Server is needed to load sound samples via XHR requests (browsers prohibit XHR requests to local files).
